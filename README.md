# Csharp_Practice

This is a practice repo in order to transition from Python/Java background to C# in order to use Azure more efficiently.

I'll be working in Windows using Git Bash and will incorporate Microsoft Azure and RedHat Ansible exercises, as well as Test-Driven and Scenario-Based Unit Testing using xUnit, NUnit, and MSTest.
